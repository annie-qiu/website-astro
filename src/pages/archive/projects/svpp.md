Dartmouth’s <a class="link" href="Sexual Violence Prevention Project (SVPP)">Sexual Violence Prevention Project (SVPP)</a> aims to reduce sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and harassment on campus through a comprehensive four-year curriculum. The SVPP staff and Dartmouth IT worked with DALI Lab to design and deploy a full-stack web application for students to manage their progress with the curriculum and for administrators to maintain the curriculum. Our partners requested that the solution should be intuitive and motivate students to be more engaged in the curriculum.

I worked as a UI/UX designer as well as a developer on the project. As a designer, I used UX Research methods, sketched solutions, created grayscales and hifi prototypes, and ideated a comprehensive design system to produce a MVP for the SVPP platform. As a developer, I worked on adding authentication for administrators, different permission levels for administrators, and implemented features such as allowing admins to assign curriculums to students and assign requirements to students.

The project is currently being finished up by Dartmouth ITC and will soon be deployed for all future Dartmouth students with an incoming freshman class of 1,400+.

Our design process was driven by the question: How might we create a seamless integration of SVPP education into students’ lives by eliminating elements of confusion, demotivation, and cognitive overload?
