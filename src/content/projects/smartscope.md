### Background

RavaOne: The SmartScope is a new smart microscope that allows clinicians to diagnose disorders from digital images with a physical microscope interface. 

> "A trained pathologist who would take just a few seconds to make a routine diagnosis using a traditional microscope would likely spend several minutes scrolling through high-resolution images on a monitor if they were using a computer alone."

### My Role
I worked in a team of many DALI Lab project managers, developers, and product engineers to design a prototype of the SmartScope. I updated the UI/UX design of the app paired with the physical microscope that clinicians use to navigate the digital cells they are examining.
