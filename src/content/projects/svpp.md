### Background

Dartmouth’s <a class="link" href="Sexual Violence Prevention Project (SVPP)">Sexual Violence Prevention Project (SVPP)</a> aims to *reduce sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and harassment on campus through a four-year curriculum*. The SVPP staff and Dartmouth IT worked with DALI Lab to design and deploy a full-stack web application for students to manage their progress with the curriculum and for administrators to maintain the curriculum. The platform is *currently used by all current Dartmouth students*.

### My Role

I worked as a UI/UX designer and a developer on the project. I conducted UX research and designed the hi-fi frames and style guide. As a developer, I added authentication for administrators, different permission levels for administrators, and implemented features allowing admins to assign curriculums to students and assign requirements to students.

### User Research
Our design process was driven by the question: How might we create a seamless integration of SVPP education into students’ lives by eliminating elements of confusion, demotivation, and cognitive overload?

We interviewed students and SVPP administrators to understand the current experience of managing your SVPP curriculum.

### Sketches and Grayscales

We designed pages for both the student-facing and admin-facing sides of the platform. We brainstormed ways to motivate students to feel engaged with the curriculum.

### Style Guide
We used the existing Student Wellness Center and Dartmouth style guide to remain consistent with institution branding.
