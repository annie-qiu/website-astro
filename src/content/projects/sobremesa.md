## Designing an experience to combat the generational gap — A Case Study

How might digital technology bring people of different ages together to promote connection, foster learning and strengthen understanding?


_\so-βɾe-me-sa\_ n. _(Spanish: “upon the table”): a cultural practice in many Spanish-speaking cultures of relaxed post-meal conversation._

We designed Sobremesa for CS25: Intro to UI/UX Design to help bridge the generational gap with multicultural families.

### What is the generational gap, and who experiences it?

Using secondary research, ranging from personal pieces to scholarly articles, we gained a survey understanding of the generational gap. We became interested in groups that experience the generational gap at a **heightened level** — particularly groups that face not only generational gaps, but also **cultural** or acculturation gaps. This often occurs in families that immigrate, hold different cultural or political views, etc.

One key finding explored the negative effects of cultural dissonance as experienced often within Chinese-American families. In a 2019 NIH review by Kane et. al explains,

> “This cultural dissonance has been associated with a range of adverse outcomes among youth from immigrant families, including depression, social anxiety, and externalizing problem behaviors among Asian youth, and substance and alcohol use among Hispanic adolescents.” (Kane)

We realized that this cultural gap as a consequence of generational movement has **tangible consequences in one’s quality of life.** We identified our intended audience: families that experience both cultural gaps that widen generational gaps.

**What tools exist to alleviate the cultural and generational gaps?**

We then conducted research on potential and existing solutions to this generational and cultural gap. A massive body of literature finds that intergenerational **storytelling** benefits all parties.

> “Intergenerational storytelling not only improves psychological well-being, reduces feelings of loneliness and depression of the elderly, but also contributes to the development of a strong sense of intergenerational self, which is associated with children’s increased resilience, better adjustment, and improved likelihood of overcoming challenges.” (Li)

### How do others experience the generational and/or cultural gap?

We conducted primary research to gain a more personal understanding of the generational and cultural gaps within families. We interviewed international peers, relatives of different generations (ages 18–30, 50–80).

Our questions focused on two aspects of familial relationships:

1.  How do people **build connections** with their intergenerational relatives?
2.  What kinds of **barriers** hinder connection between generations?

**Breaking down our research**

To collect deeper observations about these interviews, we created empathy maps for each interviewee, with specific focus on our original interviewing goals.

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*1R8e1RlUiYIXI6j9ZZE6yQ.png)

Based on our user interviews, we created **2x2s** based on different characteristics we noticed among our interviewees and intended audience.

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*huSowdXIft4ywtIn)![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*1EHs_uWIwr9sXY67)

In these 2x2s, we selected two cross-sections of user types to focus on. We created user profiles for Jane and Kevin. We chose these specific personas because they seem more common than others, and are also **more likely to seek out and continually use a technological tool to better connect with their family.**

Finally, we created a user journey map to more intimately visualize the steps involved in trying to connect with a grandparent of a different culture, as though from Kevin’s point of view.

### How can we build an app to help Jane and Kevin build meaningful connections with their families?

Following our user research, we had three primary insights that directed our ideating.

### Goals for our solution

The solution should:

> _1. Help users_ **_find commonalities_** _across cultural and generational differences_

Our interviewees who felt disconnected with their grandparents felt overwhelmed with cultural and generational _differences_. Our solution should encourage users to find commonalities and see their elders or grandchildren as people they share experiences, opinions, or characteristics with.

> _2. Facilitate_ **_storytelling_** _despite cultural, geographic, and linguistic barriers_

In our user interviews, we found that users from a range of age backgrounds would remember hearing a story from their grandparents and find the story helpful in forging a connection. Hearing stories helped our interviewees understand their family history and appreciate where their family came from. We want our solution to create an environment that facilitates storytelling despite users possibly facing cultural, geographic, and linguistic barriers.

> _3. Build connection across generations_ **_within a family_** _while also learning intergenerational knowledge_ **_outside your family_**

In our user interviews, one reason people cited for feeling disconnected to their grandparents included having one or several deceased grandparents. We want our solution to primarily foster connection within the generations of a family, as it is easier to build connection upon an established community, but we also want to help people who have different family situations still learn from the experiences of older generations.

### Our brainstorming process

We created mind maps, one around the question “How might we encourage people to find commonalities across generations?” and one around the question “How might we facilitate storytelling between generations?” From our mind maps, we came to the idea of a digital experience that **encourages family members to share stories, converse, or complete a shared activity**. Our solution should provide disconnected multicultural families with some form of shared experience that they can use to connect with each other.

We then brainstormed solutions with the **Crazy 8’s** method and decided on an app that **prompts family members with a shared, daily question prompt to encourage storytelling.**

### Creating a User Flow

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*fG-IpU24ykc7PzKi)

From our initial sketch, we created a user flow diagram and planned out additional pages we wanted to add. Additional pages we added include the **Family** page, where users can create, join, and edit family groups, and the **Community** page, where users can explore and save responses from around their world.

### Low Fidelity Wireframes

Once we clarified our ideas, we transformed the sketches into greyscales and created various iterations for feedback and revisions. With each iteration, we ensured that each feature was (1) purposeful and (2) increased ease of navigation.

**Home Page:** Landing page to orient the user

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*eBx-2zh7baMPTeujKR337Q.png)

**Usability Finding:** After user testing and feedback from peer designers, we chose Version 4, which featured the instant feed so that users could see content immediately. We also decided against a quantification of responses (Versions 1,2) to frame storytelling as a qualitative, emotional experience. Users also noted that Version 4 felt less cluttered than Version 3 due to increased white space.

**Profile Page:** Collection of the user’s past responses.

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*yBB-uE-lc6UoNUlki824Ig.png)

**Usability Testing:** Version 1 would be difficult for browsing text responses; Version 2 felt cluttered due to lack of uniformity. Version 3 received more positive responses, as it was uniform and added a searchability feature for easier retrieval.

**Family Page**: View and edit user’s families

![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1152/format:webp/1*zqEBlbhUSqQCUPJ8MM8pfQ.png)

**Usability Testing:** Version 2 received a better response due to decreased clutter, and a more clear hierarchy of information. The white space also helps emphasize the call to action button, “Join new family.” Although it would create more steps for the user, users preferred to edit their family at a later stage, rather than on the initial family landing page.

### Creating a Visual Design System

We created a moodboard to guide the visual identity of our app and decided on a visual identity that conveyed warmth and storytelling. We decided on a burnt orange-red and beige as our primary colors and created variations of these shades for our secondary colors. The warm color tones and subtle shifts reflected our app’s theme of comfort.

We used a serif font for headers as a reference to the serif fonts used in books, and we chose a modern sans serif font for body text.

By using a serif font and a warm color scheme, we wanted to differentiate our app from the sans serif fonts and blue tones found in many social media apps and express that our app encourages storytelling and fostering genuine connections.

### Our Final Solution

**Home**

For many multicultural families, it is simply not the norm to regularly share stories. Our digital solution prompts family members with a daily, shared question to encourage family members to share about their lives, reconsider misconceptions they have, and find points of commonalities organically. Questions and responses can be translated into the languages of the user’s family, and users have the ability to specify which families can see their post and whether their post goes to their families or is visible publicly.

**Family**

Users can **manage family groups** to allow for multiple sides of their families or extended families. Family groups can be edited to customize a family’s information, its members, and the languages a family speaks.

**Community**

To help users **hear from voices outside their own family**, users can view responses to the daily question from around the world on the **Explore** page. Responses can be curated into categories to **highlight a variety of stories**.

### Usability Insights

Following usability testing, we received feedback that users needed **more guidance** and **descriptive words** for features. We also found that older users found the app to be more difficult to use than how younger users found it. To respond, we added text labels for icons on the navigation bar. On the home page before the drop-down menu where users can select which families to view, we added a label text “Posts from:” to indicate the purpose of the drop-down menu. We added strokes around certain toggle buttons to increase contrast and make the function of these buttons more clear.

### Where do we go from here?

Sobremesa was created as a potential solution to the lack of connection across generations and cultures. We received a mix of responses throughout the testing process, but by integrating feedback and analyzing our progress with a critical eye, we created a simple but effective tool.

**How can we better design?**

One of our greatest hurdles was designing for such an explicitly broad user base — people from older and younger generations alike. After user testing, we added increased guidance via labels on icons and sections, but this may not constitute a sufficient revision. A more thorough solution may be designing a tutorial for new users, which would be a point to consider for future work. Through more rounds of user testing, we hope to improve upon this design to increase accessibility.

**How can we motivate users to use–and continue to use–Sobremesa?**

Another point of future development could also consider the use of motivational elements to keep users invested and engaged. We thoroughly considered the addition of elements like “streaks” or “leaderboards” to encourage users to stay engaged. However, after reflection on intentionality, we decided against incorporating such features. Future rounds of user testing would be extremely helpful in further deciding upon these features.
